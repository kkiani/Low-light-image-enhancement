Low light image enhancement with ResNet and Keras

# 1. Introduction

In this project we are going to build a deep convolutional neural network model to improve low ligth images. we will compare our model to classic image proccessing method (median filter).

**About dataset:**

So I have a knack of photography and travelling. I wanted to create a model for myself which can classify my own pictures. But to be honest, a Data Scientist should always know how to collect data. So I scraped data from google images using a Python Script and using other en-source data sources from MIT, Kaggle itself, etc. Request everyone to give a try. I'll update the no. of images in validation set as time goes on.

The link to the scripting file is here:

The images belong typically to 4 classes:

* Art & Culture
* Architecture
* Food and Drinks
* Travel and Adventure
